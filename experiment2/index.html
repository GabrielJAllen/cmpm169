				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>So this experiment is trying to simulate ocean waves rippling</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>So aside from what the sample code is doing in this project, the significant additions I added were an array of three roughly equally distant points on the canvas,
					which served as the peaks of the wave that should be colored in white, as well as having the logic during the drawing process understand where they are in relation
					to those peaks. As the lines get drawn in the waves slowly move from left to right and wrap back around.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>So this was a relatively easy process, after seeing the base output from the code sample I started with, I thought about what natural processes occurr in 
					diagonal lines, and waves came to mind. So after tweaking the parameters of the initial code all I had to figure out was how to have the lines consider where
					they were in the waves as how to adjust the colors. The only difficulties in the process was just due to outside events causing undue stress.
